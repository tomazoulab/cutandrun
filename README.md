## Introduction

**nf-core/cutandrun** is a best-practice bioinformatic analysis pipeline for CUT&Run and CUT&Tag experimental protocols that where developed to study protein-DNA interactions and epigenomic profiling.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It is capable of using docker/singularity containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible. The [Nextflow DSL2](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/dsl2.html) implementation of this pipeline uses one container per process which makes it easier to maintain and update software dependencies. Where possible, these processes have been submitted to and installed from [nf-core/modules](https://github.com/nf-core/modules).

The pipeline has been developed with continuous integration (CI) in mind. nf-core code and module linting as well as a battery of over 100 unit and integration tests run on pull request to the main repository and on release of the pipeline. On official release, automated CI tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources. The results obtained from the full-sized test can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/cutandrun/results).

## Pipeline summary

1. Check input files

14. Present QC for raw read, alignment and duplicate reads ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))

## Quick Start

1. Install [`Nextflow`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation) (`>=21.04.0`)

2. Install any of [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/), [`Podman`](https://podman.io/), [`Shifter`](https://nersc.gitlab.io/development/shifter/how-to-use/) or [`Charliecloud`](https://hpc.github.io/charliecloud/) for full pipeline reproducibility _(please only use [`Conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) as a last resort; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#basic-configuration-profiles))_

3. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command:

    ```console
    nextflow run nf-core/cutandrun -profile test,<docker/singularity/podman/shifter/charliecloud/conda/institute>
    ```

    > * Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. This will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution settings for your local compute environment.
    > * If you are using `singularity` then the pipeline will auto-detect this and attempt to download the Singularity images directly as opposed to performing a conversion from Docker images. If you are persistently observing issues downloading Singularity images directly due to timeout or network issues then please use the `--singularity_pull_docker_container` parameter to pull and convert the Docker image instead. Alternatively, it is highly recommended to use the [`nf-core download`](https://nf-co.re/tools/#downloading-pipelines-for-offline-use) command to pre-download all of the required containers before running the pipeline and to set the [`NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` or `singularity.cacheDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/singularity.html?#singularity-docker-hub) Nextflow options to be able to store and re-use the images from a central location for future pipeline runs.
    > * If you are using `conda`, it is highly recommended to use the [`NXF_CONDA_CACHEDIR` or `conda.cacheDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/conda.html) settings to store the environments in a central location for future pipeline runs.

4. Start running your own analysis!

    * Typical command for CUT&Run/CUT&Tag analysis:

        ```bash
        nextflow run nf-core/cutandrun \
            -profile <docker/singularity/podman/conda/institute> \
            --input samplesheet.csv \
            --genome GRCh38
        ```

See [usage docs](https://nf-co.re/cutandrun/usage) for all of the available options when running the pipeline.

## Documentation

The nf-core/cutandrun pipeline comes with documentation about the pipeline [usage](https://nf-co.re/cutandrun/usage), [parameters](https://nf-co.re/cutandrun/parameters) and [output](https://nf-co.re/cutandrun/output).

## Credits

nf-core/cutandrun was originally written by Chris Cheshire ([@chris-cheshire](https://github.com/chris-cheshire)) and Charlotte West ([@charlotte-west](https://github.com/charlotte-west)) from [Luscombe Lab](https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/labs/nicholas-luscombe) at [The Francis Crick Institute](https://www.crick.ac.uk/), London, UK.

The pipeline structure and parts of the downstream analysis were adapted from the original CUT&Tag analysis [protocol](https://yezhengstat.github.io/CUTTag_tutorial/) from the [Henikoff Lab](https://research.fredhutch.org/henikoff/en.html).

We thank Harshil Patel ([@drpatelh](https://github.com/drpatelh)) and everyone in the Luscombe Lab ([@luslab](https://github.com/luslab)) for their extensive assistance in the development of this pipeline.
